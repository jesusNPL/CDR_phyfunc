Repo for CDR-LTR synthesis working group.

In this repo you can find a molecular phylogeny for CDR-LTR and imputed traits for seven plant traits. 

The structure of this repo is as follows:

1) [R](https://github.com/jesusNPL/CDR_phyfunc/tree/main/R) - scripts used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationship of plants in Cedar Creek. 

2) [phylogeny](https://github.com/jesusNPL/CDR_phyfunc/tree/main/phylogeny) - include several subfolders, and the most relevant (maybe) for you is the subfolder [4.Timetree/Tacted](https://github.com/jesusNPL/CDR_phyfunc/tree/main/phylogeny/4.Timetree/Tacted). This folder contains the time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for CDR under three levels of taxonomic constraints. 

3) [traits](https://github.com/jesusNPL/CDR_phyfunc/tree/main/traits) - this folder contains imputed leaf traits for CDR. The observed traits were obtained from [DÃ­az et al. 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01774-9).
